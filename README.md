So some design points
- Create a organized project that will support development for advent of code problems
- Command to run specific problems (python advent.py --run problem6)
- Command to pull and correctly store data files for problems (python advent.py --download problem6)
- Possible helper functions to review the problem without the need of the site (python advent.py --help problem6)
- *Optional* Have a setup command for a new problem which would create new file in the project and add comments for the actual problem (python advent.py --setup problem6)
- GIT
